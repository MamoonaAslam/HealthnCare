# Headache Altering The Normal Life
Headache, an almost universal human experience, is one of the most common complaints encountered in medicine and neurology. Described and categorized since antiquity, with the first classification by Aretaeus of Cappadocia, other classifications followed. The evaluation of this condition may be straightforward or challenging, and, though often benign, a headache may prove to be an ominous symptom. This review discusses the current diagnosis and classification of headache disorders and principles of management, with a focus on migraine, tension-type headache, trigeminal autonomic cephalgias, and various types of daily headaches. It’s hard to think about the causes of headaches when you’re struggling with pain. Once you’re feeling better, figuring out what leads to the agony can help you dodge it in the future. This requires you to pay attention to the environment, eating habits, and activities that spark headache discomfort.
### Types and causes of headaches:

The most common types of headaches are sinus, tension, and migraine headaches. Sinus headaches usually occur when there is infection or pressure in the sinuses. Tension headaches strike when the muscles in the head and neck tighten. Migraines come on when supersensitive nerve endings in the brain create pain.

But what makes the muscles tense, or causes some nerve endings in the brain to become so sensitive? That’s not as well understood. Those causes of headaches can vary from person to person. But some triggers are common. Tension headaches are often set off by:

    stress
    lack of sleep
    fatigue
    hunger
    caffeine withdrawal
    abrupt cessation of medications that contain caffeine, such as some pain-relieving medications like ibuprofen (Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol)
    weather changes
    food and drinks, such as chocolate; processed foods that contain monosodium glutamate (MSG); or alcohol

### Serious causes of headaches:

Some headaches are a symptom of an underlying physical condition. For example, sometimes a headache can signal that your blood pressure is above what's considered a normal reading of 120/80 mm Hg or lower. High blood pressure is a risk factor for developing heart disease or stroke, so make sure to get your blood pressure checked regularly, especially if you experience headaches, or suspect that high blood pressure is one of your causes of headaches.

Other health conditions that may be lead to headache pain include bleeding, infection, or a tumor, although headaches are rarely a sign of more ominous disease. Contact your doctor promptly if a headache is sudden, or accompanied by fever, convulsions, fainting, or pain in the eye or ear.

### How to avoid a headache:

#### Maintaining a regular sleep schedule.
Getting too little sleep and oversleeping can trigger headaches, as can getting up and going to bed at inconsistent times. Go to bed and get up about the same time every day.
    
#### Watching what you eat and drink — and when. 
Don’t skip or delay meals. And drink plenty of water. Also, avoid foods that can trigger headaches. This is particularly true if you suffer migraine headaches. Common food and beverage triggers include caffeine, monosodium glutamate (MSG), aged cheese, sausage, red wine, and other alcoholic beverages.

#### Controlling stress. 
Learn techniques to help you relax and reduce emotional stress, which may be caused by overwork, job loss, financial difficulties, or family problems. Stress can cause muscles to tense up and trigger headaches. Stress relief techniques include deep breathing, visualization, progressive relaxation, and biofeedback.

#### Exercising regularly. 
Exercising 30 minutes at least three days a week is good for your overall health and can help prevent migraines and tension headaches. Low-impact aerobic exercise prevents tension as it strengthens your muscles and keeps them flexible.

#### Preventing eye strain. 
Reading in dim light, extended computer use without a break, and a weak, outdated eyeglass prescription can strain your eyes and the muscles around them — and lead to a headache.

#### Avoiding odors and fumes. 
A variety of scents and fumes — from perfume, paint, gasoline, and cleaning products, as well as tobacco smoke — can trigger headaches. Switch to unscented household products.
